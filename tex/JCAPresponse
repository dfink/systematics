Dear Editor,

thank you for the timely and helpful referee report. We are happy to provide
the requested minor revisions.

In detail, our replies to the referee's comments are as follows:

1) We admit that we were not very specific at this point. One way to
assess the variability in a way that does not depend too much on the
background fluxes outside of the line's energy range is to just consider
the number of events close to 130 GeV that were measured in the
first half and the second half of the full data taking period. This is
easy to do by counting the marked circles in Fig. 9.  There is
no indication for a significant bias towards the first or second half.
However, we also checked with explicit subsampling of the data, as well as
with analytical estimates, that the fluctuations of the TS value around its
linear trend are at 95%CL within the statistically expected variations. We
clarified this in the text (very end of section II).


2) The expected residual background of cosmic rays from the direction of
the GC region in the CLEAN (SOURCE) event class is roughly about 2%
(10%) [see e.g. Reg4 in Fig. 1 from 1204.2797]. It is indeed an
interesting question in how far a local proton source, accidentally
aligned with the Galactic center, could produce the observed
signal. However, the proton flux measured by PAMELA does not show any
indication for an excess in the Galactic center direction [1].
Furthermore, a 130 GeV monochromatic flux of protons would not be
reconstructed as 130 GeV photons. It is hence difficult to see how such
a hypothetical source could produce the observed signature.

The relevant paragraph now begins with:

"Bright regions provide samples with a high gamma-ray-to-CR ratio that are used
for calibration by the LAT team~\cite{collaboration:2012kca}.  For example,
the Galactic center ($\psi < 5\degree$) contains $\sim 40$ times as many
$E>100$ GeV \texttt{CLEAN} events per square degree as the high latitude sky
($|b| > 30 \degree$).  Assuming the CR contamination at $E>100$ GeV is
spatially uniform, and that more than half of the high latitude \texttt{CLEAN}
events are photons, the gamma-ray-to-CR ratio in the Galactic center is of
order 100 or more. 


3) We replaced the first sentence of the abstract with:

"Our recent claims of a Galactic center feature in Fermi-LAT data at
approximately 130 GeV have motivated a large number of papers proposing
explanations ranging from dark matter annihilation to monoenergetic
pulsar winds."

We also slightly rephrased the third paragraph of the introduction.

We hope that with these changes our paper is now acceptable for publication in
JCAP.

Best regards,

Christoph Weniger, for the authors
