\begin{abstract} Our recent claims of a Galactic center feature in Fermi/LAT
  data at approximately 130 GeV have prompted an avalanche of papers proposing
  explanations ranging from dark matter annihilation to exotic pulsar winds.
  Because of the importance of such interpretations for physics and
  astrophysics, the threshold for discovery is unusually high.  This requires
  not only additional data, but a thorough investigation of possible LAT
  systematics.  While we do not have access to the details of each event
  reconstruction, we do have information about each event from the public
  event lists and spacecraft parameter files.  These data allow us to search
  for suspicious trends that could indicate a spurious signal.  In particular,
  the Earth limb photons provide a smooth reference spectrum for null tests.
  We examine these events and find a marginally significant 130 GeV feature in
  a small subset of the data.  This raises concerns about the 130 GeV Galactic
  center feature, even though we can think of no plausible model of
  instrumental behavior that connects the two.  A modest amount of additional
  limb data would tell us if the limb feature is a statistical fluke.  If the
  limb feature persists, it raises serious concerns about the Pass 7
  processing of $E > 100$ GeV events.

\section{Introduction}
The search for dark matter takes many forms:  exploration of its astrophysical
properties, direct detection in underground labs, and even collider signatures
of WIMPs or related particles.  (cite reviews).   Etc. 

A gamma-ray line is a long-sought smoking gun for WIMP annihilation. 

We were not optimistic, because the branching ratio to lines is loop
suppressed, and one would have expected to see a continuum first in e.g. MSSM
models.  However, there are other models (e.g. MiDM) that allow high line to
continuum ratios.  In this work, we drop all theoretical prejudice and simply
ask if there is a line in the Galactic center spectrum. 

The first claim of a line around 130 GeV emerged from the work of Weniger
(cite), which grew out of an earlier search for other hard photon signals from
annihilations (Bringmann).  Weniger focused on spectral fitting to photon
events in regions of interest designed to maximize S/N.  He found a XXX sigma
signal at 130 GeV. 

Subsequent work by Su \& Finkbeiner approached the problem with template
fitting, assuming various profiles (Einasto, NFW, Gaussian) for the DM
distribution.  If the template is correct, this should allow extraction of the
DM signal with higher S/N.   This work found XXX sigma for an Einasto profile
centered $1.5\degree$ W of the Galactic center, and also suggest that there
may be two lines, at about 111 and 129 GeV.  The lower energy is tantalizing
because it matches the expected energy of a $Z\gamma$ line if the higher
energy is the $\gamma\gamma$ line. 

These papers have provoked theorists to try to reconcile the observations with
a number of theories (cite dozens of papers).  But all of this work depends on
the question:

Possible systematic errors:

- Extra events

{\bf Low energy photons:} Events would have to be mistakenly mapped from
either lower energy ($E \la 10$ GeV) gammas or much lower energy photons
(X-rays from the 1E $1740.7-2942$ microquasar?  511 keV photons?) in which the
Galactic center is much brighter.  It is difficult to see how this could
happen.

{\bf High energy photons:} At $E > 100$ GeV, the Galactic center is only
modestly brighter than the surrounding regions, so there are not enough
photons available.

{\bf Particle contamination:} If monochromatic photons from the limb are
difficult to explain, it is even harder to understand how mono-energetic
particles could be present. 

{\bf Effective area error:} An error in the LAT effective area (e.g. various
cuts are less restrictive for some reason) for $30\degree < \theta <
45\degree$ could explain the limb photons, but would also produce a line
everywhere in the Galactic plane.  No such line is seen outside of the GC. 

From these considerations, we conclude that there is no way for the limb line
to be caused by extra events. 

However, it is still plausible that there is a more subtle energy mapping
error that distorts the energy scale near 130 GeV.  In the next section, we
argue that this is a reasonable explanation of the limb line, but not of the
GC lines. 

\section{Energy mapping error: a model for the limb bump}
Given the difficulty in explaining the excess any other way, we consider the
possibility that the limb bump results from an energy mapping error.  We
propose a simple model, in which the mapping from true energy to reported
energy, $E(E_t)$, is linear except for a bump near some reference energy.
Smooth low-level perturbations over large energy scales are not relevant here,
and could be absorbed in the effective area calibration.  In order to include
a small-scale bump in the response, we introduce a local compact perturbation
in the form of a Gaussian.  It is convenient to work in logarithmic
quantities, so we take $x=\log E_t, y=\log E$, and
\be
\label{eq:yofx}
y=x - A\sigma \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right),
\ee
where $A$ is a dimensionless amplitude of the bump ($-1<A<1$ is required
for monotonicity of $y(x)$), $x_0$ is a reference energy, and $\sigma$ is the
width of the bump (see Figure \ref{fig:bumpmodel}).
The effect of the distortion is to change the true spectrum $dN/dx =
dN/dlog(E_t)$ into an observed spectrum
\be
\label{eq:dndy}
\frac{dN}{dy} = \frac{dN}{dx} \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{-1} ,
\ee
with
\be
\label{eq:dydx}
\frac{dy}{dx} = 1 + A\sigma \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
\frac{x-x_0}{\sigma^2}.
\ee
Note that that the extreme values of $dy/dx = 1 \pm A$ occur at $x-x_0 = \pm
\sigma$ and at $y=x_0(\pm1-A)\sigma$.  Assuming the true limb spectrum is a
power law, we may apply this factor to obtain a model spectrum, and maximize
the Poisson likelihood of observing the data given the model.

To illustrate that this model can generate a spectrum similar to the limb bump
spectrum, we show 10 random realizations of a $dN/dE \sim E^{-2.6}$ spectrum
with this distortion in Figure \ref{fig:bumpmodelmany}.
Some of these look very similar to the bump in Figure \ref{fig:Ehist-all}.


\section{Future}
Ways to progress.

One to two weeks of additional limb data would provide an exposure comparable
to teh limb photons used here.  One option would be to release comissioning
data from early in the survey, if they are thought to be of sufficient
quality.  Otherwise, new limb observations could be undertaken, in order to
test teh reality of the 130 GeV limb feature.  

If the 130 GeV feature is not replicated, it can be dismissed as a statistical
fluke.  If it reappears, a deppr inestigation into its cause is warrented.  

even then, it is a challenge to understand how such an instrumental feature
could be mapped so precisely onto a localized region within 5-10 degrees of
the GC.  The GC is not near the path of the orbital pole, nor its axis of
precession.  The orbital phase, precession, Earth's orbit, and time of year
are all well mixed by the few $\times10^4$ orbits and 25 precession cycles
over 1500 days.  We have shown that the events in question are drawn from
every part of event and spacecraft parameter space available in teh public
files.  In the absence of any model of instrumental behavior that explains how
these events land near the GC and not elsewhere in the Galactic plane, it is
far fetched to say that they invalidate a result with a local signiifcance of
$p\approx10^{-9}$.
