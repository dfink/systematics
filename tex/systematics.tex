\begin{abstract} Our recent claims of a Galactic center
  feature in Fermi/LAT data at approximately 130 GeV have
  prompted an avalanche of papers proposing explanations
  ranging from dark matter annihilation to exotic pulsar
  winds.  Because of the importance of such interpretations

  is unusually high.  This requires not only additional

  In particular, the Earth limb photons provide a smooth
  reference spectrum for null tests.  We examine these
  events and find a marginally significant 130 GeV feature
  in a small subset of the data.  This raises concerns about
  the 130 GeV Galactic center feature, even though we can
  think of no plausible model of instrumental behavior that
  connects the two.  A modest amount of additional limb data
  would tell us if the limb feature is a statistical fluke.
  If the limb feature persists, it raises serious concerns
  about the Pass 7 processing of $E > 100$ GeV events.

\section{Introduction}


The search for non-gravitational signatures from dark matter
has been generally taken place in three different
directions: missing energy searching from colliders, direct
searches for the recoil of nuclei from underground detectors,
and indirect methods including searching dark matter signal
from cosmic rays and multiwavelength astronomical
observations~\citep{Jungman:1995df,Bergstrom:2000,Bertone:2005,Hooper:2007Review, 2012arXiv1205.4882B}.

For indirect direction, distinguishing the dark matter
signal from conventional astrophysical backgrounds is challenging.
Among various possible signatures, gamma-ray line
emission has been considered as a long-sought ``smoking
gun'' for dark matter annihilation, as no plausible
astrophysical background can produce such line
signature\footnote{although a narrow feature is possible
  \citep[see][]{2012arXiv1207.0458A}}. 
Gamma-ray line(s) could be produced by dark matter
decays or annihilations into two photons, or two-body final
states involving one photon plus a Higgs boson, Z boson, or
other neutral non-SM particle. Unfortunately, in most models the
branching ratio to lines is loop suppressed relative to the
continuum emission, and one would have expected to see the
continuum first in e.g. MSSM
models~\citep[e.g.][]{Bergstrom:1997}.  Although this
theoretical prejudice led most previous studies to focus on
continuum searches, there are models being proposed that
allow high line to continuum
ratios~\citep[e.g.][]{Bergstrom:1998, Bergstrom:2000,
  Bertone:2009, Jackson:2010, Cline:2012, Weiner:2012}.

The first claim of a line around 130 GeV emerged recently
from the work of Weniger~\citep{Weniger:2012}, which grew out of an
earlier search for other hard photon signals from
annihilations~\citep{Bringmann:2012}.  Weniger focused on
spectral fitting to photon events in regions of interest
designed to maximize S/N.  He found a 4.6$\sigma$
(3.2$\sigma$ after the trials factor correction) line
structure at 130 GeV .

Subsequent work by Su \& Finkbeiner approached the problem
with template fitting, which takes into account the spatial
distribution of events along with spectral information, assuming
various profiles (Einasto, NFW, Gaussian) for the DM
distribution~\citep{linepaper}.  If the template is correct,
this should allow extraction of the DM signal with higher
S/N.  This work found 6.6$\sigma$ (5.1$\sigma$ after the
trials factor correction) for an Einasto profile centered
$1.5\degree$ west of the Galactic center, and also suggested
that there may be two lines, at about 111 and 129 GeV.  The
lower energy line is tantalizing because it matches the
expected energy of a $Z\gamma$ line if the higher energy is
the $\gamma\gamma$ line.  

Recent evidence for lines at 111
GeV and 129 GeV with a local significance of $3.3\sigma$
from Fermi unassociated point sources suggests an annihilation signal is
present, as does the claim of line emission from galaxy clusters at 130
GeV~\cite{galaxyclusters}.  Neither of these would stand on their own, but
they provide support for the hypothesis that the Galactic center line signal
is indeed from dark matter annihilation~\cite{doubleline}.

{\bf put this sentence somewhere else?}
These papers have provoked theorists to try to reconcile the
observations with a number of models~\citep{Dudas:2012,
  Choi:2012, Kyae:2012, Lee:2012, Rajaraman:2012,
  Acharya:2012, Garny:2012, Buckley:2012, Chu:2012,
  Kang:2012, Buchmuller:2012, Heo:2012, Park:2012,
  Tulin:2012, Cline:2012, Weiner:2012}. 

If one believes the statistical significance of this line feature, it
motivates a search for systematic errors in the LAT data that could mimic a
line in the Galactic center.  Confirmation by H.E.S.S II is possible in the
next year~\cite{Bergstrom:2012}, but in the meantime a thorough study of LAT
systematics is urgently needed.  We do not have access to the details of the
reconstruction of each photon event, which would allow us to study how it
developed in the tracker and calorimeter.  However, we do have information
about each event from the public event lists and spacecraft parameter files.
We can use this information to search for any line-producing artifacts in the
detector frame, and investigate if they could map onto the Galactic center. 

A smooth reference spectrum is provided by the so-called ``Earth limb
photons,'' sometimes referred as ``albedo photons''. Nearly grazing incidence
cosmic rays initiate cascades in the Earth's atmosphere, making 
gamma-rays which can
penetrate the upper thin layer of atmosphere without strong
attenuation and produce a bright gamma-ray
horizon~\citep[e.g.][and reference therein]{FermiLimb}.
The gamma-ray emission from Earth is produced by
cosmic-ray (mostly protons, helium, and heavier nuclei)
interactions with atmosphere material. Earth limb gamma-rays
at$\sim$100 GeV are mainly from the decay of neutral pions
and kaons. At this energy, due to the kinematics of the
collisions, the cross section are peaked in the forward
direction, and the back-scattered secondary particles at
large angles relative to the direction of the cosmic-ray
cascade is very rare. {\bf too much detail in this paragraph?}

In this paper, we use Earth limb photons contained in LAT
publically available 4 years data to search for any
suspicious trends that could indicate a spurious line signal
at 130 GeV.  We examine these events in detail and compare
with the line photons from the Galactic center.  In
\Refsec{130GeV} we briefly define the key parameters to
describe the LAT photon events and its survey strategy. We
examine several possible pecularities of Galactic center
observation and systematics of LAT instrument which we can
think of might introduce suspecious line signal. In
\Refsec{EarthLimb}, we use the Earth limb photons and assume
its smooth nature in spectrum to look for line-like feature
in much detail. Finally in \Refsec{Conclusion}, we discuss
our findings and implications to the 130 GeV line search.


\section{The 130 GeV excess}
\label{sec:130GeV}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION II %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section, we briefly summarize the standard survey strategy of \Fermi\ 
and introduce basic parameters of each event.  We will
ask the question whether observations of the Galactic center
are peculiar in a way that could enhance instrumental
effects towards this direction and search for suspicious trends in
other regions of the sky and the reconstruction parameters.

%% Rock angle is 50, orbit precesses in 55 days, leading to nearly uniform
%% exposure.  Occasional ToO observations.

\subsection{Standard survey strategy and definitions}
\label{sec:conventions}
%% A. Standard survey strategy

%%   Define parameters (See table)

%%   Discuss standard events selection.

%% B. Peculiarities of the Galactic center observation

%%   we consider 3 ways to get a spurious signal

%%   1.  Incidence angles of Galactic Center observations
%%       The orbit / scan strategy impose certain patterns on (theta,phi)
%%       just from geometry.  If there are instrumental artifacts for such
%%       events, they could map disproportionately on to the GC.

%%       We choose events at those phi values away from the GC and find no
%%       excess of events near 111 or 130 GeV.  (Figs 2,3)

%%   2.  The Galactic center is bright
%%       Because the center is bright, a flaw in the instrument / data
%%       reduction that maps events to 130 GeV might only be noticed in a
%%       bright region of the sky.  However, we have other regions (limb,
%%       plane) that have lots of photons, and we see now 130 GeV excess in
%%       those samples.

%%   3.  The Galactic center has a hard spectrum
%%       Perhaps events could be mis-reconstructed, mapping events down
%%       from higher energy.  However, there are not even enough events
%%       above 300 GeV to explain the signal, even if all of them got
%%       mapped to 130 GeV.

In \emph{standard survey mode}, the LAT points at zenith
angle \zrock\ offset north from the zenith perpendicular to
the orbit and \zrock\ south of the zenith (the opposite side
of the orbital plane) on the next, surveying the northern
and southern hemispheres on each orbit. The survey mode are
performed with a repeating pattern of slews with 17
waypoints about the velocity vector, the waypoint defines
the time and the corresponding angle at which the LAT
boresight is rocked north (on one orbit) or south (on the
other orbit) of the orbit plane\footnote{The survey mode can
be also performed with alternate explicit slew
commands}\footnote{The survey pattern profiles are available
at
\url{http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/observations/types/allsky/}.
The effective dates and times for each profile are provided.
}. \zrock\ was $35\degree$ since the start of the nominal
mission on August 4, 2008 to May 7th, 2009, but was changed
to $50\degree$ on Sep 3rd, 2009 for better thermal
management of the downward-facing battery
radiator\footnote{Different observatory sky-survey profiles
with rocking angle 39$\degree$, 40$\degree$, and 45$\degree$
respectively have been tested with relatively short periods,
including the 3 orbit profile test for various rocking
angles.}. This rocking profile, combined with the precession
of the orbit every $\sim$55 days, allows the LAT to cover
the whole sky every two orbits with the most uniform sky
coverage in a short time.

This survey mode is only occasionally interrupted for
pointed observations of targets of opportunity (ToOs). The
total amount of time in the pointed observations is $<$20\%
of the total observing time. Fermi's survey observations are
regularly interrupted during passages through the South
Atlantic Anomaly. This interruption results in an exposure
differential between north and south of ~15\%. In addition,
sky-survey is occasionally interrupted by Autonomous
Repoints of the observatory for the purpose of triggered
gamma-ray bursts follow up observations.  

We have defined the relevant event parameters used in this
paper in Tab.~\ref{tab:parameters}: $\theta$ is the
reconstructed incidence angle of the photon event with
respect to the LAT boresight -- defined as the $z$-axis
while the $y$-axis is parallel to the solar panels; $\phi$
is the reconstructed incidence angle with respect to the
$+y$ axis (the normal to the $y-z$ plane with positive
defined as facing the Sun, or along the orbiting velocity
vector). The Zenith angle $Z$ is defined as the angle
between the reconstructed event direction and the zenith
line, which is connecting the Earth center with the
satellite center.  Lastly, \zrock\ is the rocking angle of
the satellite (the the boresight angle north of the zenith)
at the time of the event.  All angles are in units of
degrees.

  \label{tab:regions}
\end{table*}

In Tab.~\ref{tab:regions} we define some key sky and
paramter regions %(cuts on the full set of events) that we
will use throughout this work: `Standard events' are all
events with the zenith angle cut $Z<100^\circ$ recommended
by the LAT team, which avoids contamination with the Earth
limb photons (see Section~\ref{sec:EarthLimb}); `Inner
Galactic plane' refers to a part of the Galactic disk close
to but without the center; `Galactic center' events are
defined as coming from within a radius of $3^\circ$ around
$\ell=b=0^\circ$; `Earth limb events' are defined as all
events with zenith angles $Z>110^\circ$, and completely
dominated by photons generated in CR interaction with the
atmosphere. `Line' events refer to subsets with energies
between $120$ and $138$ GeV. This energy range is selected
since the dominant line at the GC is found to be around 129
GeV~\cite{linepaper}, and the FWHM of the line is about
13.6\%~\cite{Weniger:2012}.

Throughout, we will use \texttt{P7CLEAN\_V6} events from 4
Aug 2008 to 18 Jul 2012, with the good-time-interval cuts
\texttt{DATA\_QUAL==1} and \texttt{LAT\_CONFIG==1}, however
without the commonly adopted cut on the rocking angle
$|$\zrock$|<52^\circ$, unless stated otherwise. This last cut would remove
all low incidence angle Earth limb events.

  with $E>100\GeV$ that enter our analysis (gray dots; see

  events (red dots; see Tab.~\ref{tab:regions}) and of
  suspicious Earth limb events (blue dots; see
  Tab.~\ref{tab:regions} `Earth limb line'), as function of
  the instrumental coordinates $\theta$ and $\phi$. The
  Earth limb contribution is clearly visible in the gray
  dots at $\theta > 61^\circ$.}
  \label{fig:phiThetaDist}
\end{figure}

Due to the large rocking angle of \zrock$\simeq50\degree$
since September 2009, photons from the Earth limb (seen
under zenith angles of $Z\sim113^\circ$; see discussion
below) entered the FOV of the LAT. In
Fig~\ref{fig:phiThetaDist}, the gray dots show the
distribution of \emph{all} events (i.e.~without $Z$ cut)
with energies above 100 GeV as function of the instrumental
incidence polar and azimuthal angles $\theta$ and $\phi$.
The contribution from the Earth limb is clearly visible at
$\theta>60^\circ$. For comparison, the red and blue dots
show the `GC line' and the `Earth limb line' events that
will be discussed below.

\subsection{Peculiarities of the Galactic center observation}
The fact that the dominant 130 GeV line signal is near the
Galactic center raises a number of concerns.  The gamma-ray
flux at the GC is somewhat brighter and might have a harder
spectrum than neighboring regions. Also, the GC is near the
ecliptic ($\beta \approx -5\degree$) and may be observed in
a restricted range of angles in instrument coordinates
$(\theta, \phi)$ when the Sun passes near it.  We consider
whether these facts could exacerbate any systematic errors
in the LAT data to produce a spurious signal.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: The Galactic center is bright, so
instrumental artifacts are more significant there}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{plots/target_spectra.eps}
  \caption{Energy distribution in various bright regions as
  discussed in the text. None of them show the excess events
  around 130 GeV seen in the Galactic center. The red dotted
  lines indicate 111 and 129 GeV.}
  \label{fig:target_spectra}
\end{figure}

On a typical day, the hardware trigger rate of the LAT is
about $10^3$--$10^4\Hz$, whereas the rate of actually
accepted SOURCE and CLEAN class events is below
$3\Hz$~\citep{collaboration:2012kca}, the rate of $>100\GeV$ events
being even much lower. In light of these low trigger rates
(and assuming steady sources and CR background fluxes) it
it difficult to imagine that the instrumental response of the LAT
would depend on the brightness of a observed region.
However, besides the Galactic center (with a flux of $XXX
\ph\cm^{-2}\s^{-1}\sr^{-1}$) a few other bright regions
exisit, and we check whether they show indications for
suspicious features at 130 GeV. Among these regions are the
Earth limb (with \emph{all} impact angles and a flux of $XXX
\ph \cm^{-2}\s^{-1}\sr^{-1}$) and the inner Galactic plane
($XXX\ph\cm^{-2}\s^{-1}\sr^{-1}$), see
Tab.~\ref{tab:regions}. Another `region' with very high
statistics but a somewhat smaller flux (
$XXX\ph\cm^{-2}\s^{-1}\sr^{-1}$) is the whole set of
standard events excluding the region around the GC
($\psi>10^\circ$).
% CW: I will fill in the numbers later

% These targets provide a large number of high energy photons
% that can be used to check for systematic artifacts in the
% energy spectra. 
For these regions, we show the corresponding energy
distributions in Fig.~\ref{fig:target_spectra}. None of the
regions exhibit an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ excess at 130 GeV as
observed in the Galactic center. Note that in the vicinity
of the bright point sources Vela and Geminga (within
$0.8^\circ$, corresponding to $95\%$ containment angle of
the PSF) only four $>100\GeV$ events were measured (at
102.5, 111.5, 123.8 and 205.5 GeV), which makes them less
interesting for a systematic study.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra1} we show fits to the energy
spectra measured in different regions. The fits are
performed as in~\cite{Weniger:2012}. The $TS$ value is as
usual defined as $TS=-2\ln \mathcal{L}_{\rm
null}/\mathcal{L}_{\rm alt}$, where $\mathcal{L}_{\rm
null(alt)}$ is the likelihood of a fit without(with) line;
note that the line normalization is constrained to be
non-negative. Whereas the TS value in the GC region is in
our case with $TS=16.9$ relatively large, there is no
indication for line contributions in the Inner Galactic
plane or the full set of Earth limb photons (upper left and
lower panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra1}.

\emph{We emphasize that signal significances calculated from the GC region as
adopted in this paper are not sufficient to represent the full significance of
the putative signal, which is usually higher when adopting regions with
optimized signal-to-noise ratio~\cite{Weniger:2012} or a template
analysis~\cite{linepaper}. We use the GC region here since it should be
dominated by line events, making it a good starting point to look for
suspicious trends in the data.}

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: The spectra at the Galactic
center are hard, making energy mapping errors more
significant}

The Galactic center might harbour an unusually large number
of sources with very hard spectra. If these high energy
photons are occasionally mis-reconstructed with energies
close to 130 GeV, this could produce a line feature in the
data that would dominantly show up at the Galactic center.
In Tab.~\ref{tab:regions}, we list the ratio of $>300\GeV$
events to $>100\GeV$ events and of $>100\GeV$ to $>30\GeV$
events, in different regions of the sky.  Interestingly, the
Galactic center does not harbour significantly more high
energy events than other regions of the sky with higher
statistics but no feature at 130 GeV
(Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra1}). Note that
about $\sim15$ events contribute to the central part of the
line feature seen at the GC. Assuming that fluxes are not
harder than $dN/dE \propto E^{-2.0}$ (normalized to the
number of events above 150 GeV), the GC events cannot come
from energies above 300 GeV, since there would be not enough
events to make up the 130 GeV excess even if \emph{all} of
them were incorrectly mapped to 130 GeV. The possibility of
mapping errors of events close to 130 GeV will be discussed
below in Sec.~\ref{sec:EarthLimb}.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: the GC observations have a
restricted range of incidence angles on the instrument}

In case the Galactic center is predominantly observed under
specific angles in LAT instrumental coordinates, associated
instrumental problems could be projected onto the Galactic
center simply for geometrical reasons. 
%The sky coverage of
%Fermi at various incidence angles is usually approximately
%uniform, but this is not necessarily the case for the
%Galactic center.  
In late December (June), the Sun crosses the Galactic disk,
and the angular
distance between the Sun and the Galactic center
(anti-center) reduces to about $5^\circ$. Since Fermi keeps
the solar panels aligned to the Sun, this leads to an
increase of Galactic center events at instrument azimuth
angles of $\phi\approx 0^\circ$ ($\phi\approx 180^\circ$).
This behaviour is clearly visible in the upper left panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:time_phi}, where we show the $\phi$
distribution of $>10\GeV$ events from the Galactic center as
a function of time (modulo one year).  The $\theta$
distribution in the upper right panel reflects the
precession pattern with a $\sim55$ day period. Integrated
over time, the $\phi$ and $\theta$ distributions look like
in the lower panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:time_phi}, where they
are shown as function of the Galactic longitude. Close to
the GC, the $\phi$ distribution becomes significantly
bimodal. Note that this effect occurs along the full solar
circle, but only the intersection with the Galactic disk
close to the center is accompanied by a large number of
events.

It is tempting to relate the locality of the 130 GeV excess
in the Galactic plane to this inhomogeneous $\phi$
distribution. As a test, we select standard events from the
full sky (excluding $\psi < 10^\circ$) in the range $\phi=
-20\dots20^\circ\ \text{mod}\ 180^\circ$. The total number
of these events is $\sim10$ times larger than the number of
Galactic center events; an anomaly in the event
reconstruction under these $\phi$ angles should appear in
this data sample with high significance.  However, the
energy distribution shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:spectrum_phi}
shows no significant feature at 111 or 130 GeV.

\subsection{Peculiarities of the instrument}
Instrumental effects are likely to be correlated with
specific instrumental coordinates rather than sky
coordinates. In this subsection we will search for
suspicious trends at 130 GeV as function of the event
incidence angles, event quality parameters, the time
evolution of the GC signal, and check for the possibility of
`hotspots' at other regions of the sky.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: A 130 GeV features is visible
under specific incidence angles on the instrument}

% Intro

An interesting concern is that a 130 GeV feature in the
reconstructed events is visible only for events with certain
incidence angles $(\theta, \phi$) in instrumental
coordinates. The 130 GeV excess would be then imprinted on
regions of the sky that are predominantly observed under
these problematic angles.\footnote{A study of the exact
positions of the events inside the tracker and calorimeter
is not possible using public data only.
It is however difficult to conceive how these conditional
parameters could be correlated with certain regions of the
sky.}

To study line-like features under different incidence
angles, we split up the $(\theta, \phi)$ plane in different
regions as shown in the left panels of
Fig.~\ref{fig:polarPlotsAll}. We then analyse the spectrum
of all events that hit the detector under these incidence
angle patches separately and search for lines. The fits are
performed as in Ref.~\cite{Weniger:2012}, but the energy
window is fixed to 80 to 200 GeV, we assume a flat
acceptance and as line we take a simple Gaussian with $6\%$
width.

The left panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:polarPlotsAll} show from
top to bottom the results obtained (1) using all events, (2)
using Earth limb events only, and (3) using standard events
only; the latter two are obviously disjunct subsets of the
former one. For each $(\theta, \phi)$ range we quote three
numbers: the significance of a 130 GeV line-feature in terms
of the $TS$ value, the signal-to-background ratio of the
putative line signal, and the number of events above 80 GeV
that contribute to this region. The $TS$ values are also
shown by the colors for better visibility.

% Indication for correlation with $Z$ angle or statistical
% fluke
% GC line only for 50 rocking angles
% GC line independent of this range

As a further check whether energies around 130 GeV are in
some unexpected way distinct, we search for line-like
features at other energies from 100 to 160 GeV. The
resulting $TS$ values as function of the line energy are
shown in the right plots of Fig.~\ref{fig:polarPlotsAll}. In
particular the lower two plots which correspond to
independent data sets show clearly that the enhanced $TS$
values at different energies in different panels are not
correlated. Lastly, we note that the significance of the
largest $TS$ value, $TS=10.5$ (corresponding to $115\GeV$), has a $p$-value of
about $0.38$ when taking into into account
$2\times23\times2$ trials over a $\chi_{k=2}^2$ distribution
(two $Z$ ranges, $23$ incidence angle panels, $\sim2$
``independent search regions''~\cite{Vittels}). This
suggests that the smaller Earth limb line is well within the
statistical expectations once the large number of associated
trials is taken into account.

% Move up this part
However, it cannot be excluded that the 130 GeV excess in
the parts of the Earth limb indicates a real instrumental
effect. Then the energy
reconstruction under different incident angles has to somehow
depend on the zenith angle $Z$ of the events (e.g. via a
subtle correlation with the rocking angle).%, and that the
%large $TS$ values around $\theta\sim40^\circ$ actually
%indicate an instrumental effect. 
We postpone a in-depth discussion of this possibility to
section~\ref{sec:EarthLimb}; in any case more
Earth limb data will help to verify or falsify this possibility.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: The Galactic center events are flagged as badly
reconstructed}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.00\linewidth]{plots/CTBCORE_CTBBestEnergyProb.eps}
  \includegraphics[width=1.00\linewidth]{plots/Tkr1FirstLayer.eps}
  \caption{\emph{Upper panel:} Distribution of CTBCORE (the
  probability that the direction estimate is good) and
  CTBBestEnergyProb (the probability that the best energy
  chosen from the two energy estimators is correct) for
  Galactic center line events (in red), compared to the
  distribution of $>50$ GeV standard events.  \emph{Lower
  panel}: First tracker layer to show evidence of a particle
  hit for the best track reconstruction. Tracker layers are

  layers 0 and 1 come without conversion foils). The gray
  bars show the distribution averaged over all $>100$ GeV
  standard events, the green/red bars show the distribution
  for the GC line.}
  \label{fig:CTBquality}
\end{figure}

The extended LAT event files contain additional information
about the quality of the event
reconstruction.\footnote{\url{http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/%
data/analysis/documentation/Cicerone/Cicerone\_Data/LAT\_Data\_Columns.html}}
CTBCORE describes the probablity that the direction estimate
is good (roughly the probability that the reconstructed
direction falls within the nominal 68\% containment angle),
CTBBestEnergyProb the probability that the reconstructed
energy falls into the core of the energy dispersion. We show
these parameters for the the GC line events in the upper
panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:CTBquality}; the background histogram
shows the distribuion of the these parameters in standard
events above 50 GeV. No significant bias in the distribution
is visible.

The green and red bars in the lower panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:CTBquality} show the first tracker layer that
shows evidence of a particle hit for the best track
reconstruction (Tkr1FirstLayer) in case of the GC line
events.  Tracker layers are 0--17, where 0 is closest to the
calorimeter and 6--17 (2--5) corresponds to front-
(back-)converting events (tracker layers 0 and 1 come
without conversion foils). The dark gray bars show the
distribution averaged over all $>100$ GeV standard events;
the light gray bars
show for comparison the distribution of $>100$~GeV events that are in the SOURCE
but not in the CLEAN class, and hence with a high
probability cosmic-ray contamination. The distribution of the latter is significantly biased
towards the first and last tracker layers, whereas
distribution of GC line events is compatible with the
expectations for standard events.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: There are `hotspots' with
line-like features in other sky regions}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{plots/hotspot_histogram.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Histogram of TS values observed close to the GC
  (red) and in the rest of the sky (black), compared to the
  expected distribution (dashed). \textbf{(include other
  energies than 130 GeV)}.}
  \label{fig:hotspots}
\end{figure}

The 130 GeV excess is located in a narrow range of about
$\sim5^\circ$ around the Galactic center. The existence of
other
significant `hotspots' (localized regions with a significant
line-like emission at or around 130 GeV) in the sky could
indicate an instrumental effect, or point to a source class
that is concentrated to the GC. In absence of knowledge
about the distribution of such a source, we adopt the
following strategy: For each standard event above 80 GeV, we
select the 103 nearest neighbour events (in physical
coordinates; 103 is the number of events in the GC region
above 80 GeV), and calculate the TS value for a line at 130
GeV. The details of the fit correspond to what we did for
e.g.~Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra1}. We exclude cases where the
nearest neighbours are closer than $10^\circ$ to the GC to
avoid contamination with the GC signature. The distribution
of TS values obtained in this way is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:hotspots} by the black line. Though we indeed
find places in the sky with TS values as large as $TS=13$
(which indicates a local $>3\sigma$ significance), this is
in perfect agreement with the statistical expectations as
shown by the dashed line. On the other hand, the TS value
distribution in cases where the nearest neighbours overlap
with $\ell=b=0^\circ$ shows strong deviations from the
expected distribution, as shown by the red line in
Fig.~\ref{fig:hotspots}.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: The observed signal is variable}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{plots/TS_time.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Time evolution of TS values. In red we show the
  GC line, in blue the Earth limb line. Gray lines indicate
  the $68\%$ and $95\%$ CL bands for the time evolution
  obtained by removing random parts of the GC events as seen
  today.}
  \label{fig:timeevolution}
\end{figure}

The most common interpretations of the 130 GeV excess (in
terms of dark matter annihilation) would predict a steady
source. On the other hand, a strong variability could
indicate time-dependent instrumental effects. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:timeevolution} we plot how the $TS$ value of
the signal in the GC region evolved over time (red);
compared to the time-evolution of the suspicious Earth limb
line (blue). The GC curve appears to have grown most
strongly during March 2011 and February 2012, and falling
during last few months, but it lies mostly within the
statistical expectations for a steady source. The number of
GC line events (shown by the larger red circles in
Fig.~\ref{fig:timeevolution}) in the first and second half
of the observational period are respectively 12 and 14, and
consistent with a non-variable flux. However, a further
substantial decrease of the significance of the GC line
signal would start to challenge any dark matter related
interpretation.  In any case, the (very weak) indication for
a temporal pattern is not observed in case of the Earth limb
line.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we follow the weak indication of the limb
photon excess at $\sim$130 GeV and analyze the limb photons
in more detail. We show that the critical incident angles
are not (solely) responsible for the GC excess.

We begin by examining the limb events and finding a bump at
130 GeV in a subsample of these events.  We consider two
hypothesis for the origin of the bump: (1) the events come
from far away in energy; (2) the more subtle possibility
that an energy mapping error could redistribute in energy,
thus making a spectral feature. We then explore the various
parameters of the GC line events and the limb bump events.

At an altitude $a$, the geometric (unrefracted) horizon is
at zenith angle \be Z_{\rm hor} =
\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{R_\oplus}{R_\oplus+a}\right)+90\degree
\ee The Fermi orbit is nearly circular with 535~km $< a <$
564~km, yielding $Z_{\rm hor}$ in the 112.7$\degree$ to
113.3$\degree$ range, with the tangent point some 2400 km
distant.  At this distance, the 90 km height of the
atmosphere subtends about $2\degree$, or roughly $111\degree
< Z < 113\degree$.

The continual cosmic-ray cascades in the Earth's atmosphere
produce gamma rays with $dN/dE \sim
E^{-2.8}$~\citep{FermiLimb}. These Earth limb photons
provide a convenient reference sample to search for
systematics in the LAT data.  Because the limb photons
result from atmospheric cascades, they are produced by
interactions in a highly boosted frame, and cannot contain
line emission.  

In Fig. \ref{fig:theta-E}, we show the incidence angle
$\theta$ distribution as a function of events energy with $Z
> 105\degree$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:theta-E-frontback} for a
separation of \texttt{FRONT} and \texttt{BACK} converting
events).  The incidence angle on the detector $\theta$ is
defined such that $\theta=0$ corresponds to the
``boresight'' of LAT instrument (see
Tab.~\ref{tab:parameters}).  At lower zenith angles ($Z \la
105\degree$) \Fermi\ observes the sky with very little
background from the Earth limb.  For \zrock = $50\degree$
(the typical survey rocking angle, see \Refsec{130GeV}), the
limb photons are hence typically at $\theta > 60\degree$.

In 125 GeV $< E <$ 140 GeV, we find that there is an excess
of events appearing in the region of $30\degree < \theta <
45\degree$, as already indicated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:polarPlotsAll} (this $\theta$ range contains
about 5\% of the limb events). No significant excess in this
energy range has been found in other $\theta$ regions (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:Ehist-all}). We fit the Earth limb events with
incidence angles $30^\circ<\theta<45^\circ$ with a
monochromatic line at 129 GeV (shown in top panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra2}). We find a local significance of
3.2$\sigma$.

%$Z<100\degree$ and $\theta<45\degree$ (after masking out the

event distribution in Fig.~~\ref{fig:l-b}. The arrival time

photons are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:timehist}. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra2} we show the Galactic center energy
spectrum with and without incidence angle events with
$30^\circ<\theta<45^\circ$.  We have checked that this 129
GeV excess appears equally in front and back converting
events (shown in Fig.  \ref{fig:Ehist-frontback}).

\subsection{Possible Systematic Errors}

Although there is no indication of instrumental systematics
which can produce any gamma-ray line feature in the spectrum
from either Galactic center or the Earth limb events, here
we list several possibilities that might in principle fake a
line feature with extra events:

{\it Extra photons from low energy events:} Events would
have to be mistakenly mapped from either lower energy ($E
\la 10$ GeV) gammas or much lower energy photons (e.g.
X-rays from the 1E 1740.7-2942 microquasar~\cite{Gallo:2002}
or 511 keV photons~\cite{Prantzos:2011}) in which the
Galactic center is much brighter.  It is difficult to see
how this could happen.

{\it Extra photons from High energy events:} At $E > 100$
GeV, the Galactic center is only modestly brighter than the
surrounding regions, so there are not enough photons
available.

{\it Particle contamination:} If monochromatic photons from
the limb are difficult to explain, it is even harder to
understand how mono-energetic particles could be present.

{\it Effective area error:} An error in the LAT effective
area (e.g. various cuts are less restrictive for some
reason) for $30\degree < \theta < 45\degree$ could explain
the limb photons, but would also produce a line everywhere
in the Galactic plane.  No such line is seen outside of the
GC.\medskip

From these considerations, we conclude that there is no way
for the limb line to be caused by extra events. However, it
is still plausible that there is a more subtle energy
mapping error that distorts the energy scale near 130 GeV.
In the next section, we argue that this is a reasonable
explanation of the line feature revealed in the limb
photons, but {\em not} of the GC lines. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION IV %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Energy mapping error: a model for the limb bump}

% In this subsection, we discuss then the energy remapping
% model, which enhances the significance of the 130 GeV line
% feature in the limb photons.
 
Given the difficulty in explaining the excess any other way,
we consider the possibility that the limb bump results from
an energy mapping error.  We propose a simple model, in
which the mapping from true energy to reported energy,
$E(E_t)$, is linear except for a bump near some reference
energy.  Smooth low-level perturbations over large energy
scales are not relevant here, and could be absorbed in the
effective area calibration.  In order to include a
small-scale bump in the response, we introduce a local
compact perturbation in the form of a Gaussian.  It is
convenient to work in logarithmic quantities, so we take
$x=\log E_t, y=\log E$, and \be
\label{eq:yofx}
y=x - A\sigma \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right),
\ee
where $A$ is a dimensionless amplitude of the bump ($-1<A<1$
is required for monotonicity of $y(x)$), $x_0$ is a
reference energy, and $\sigma$ is the width of the bump (see
Fig. \ref{fig:bumpmodel}).  The effect of the distortion is
to change the true spectrum $dN/dx = dN/dlog(E_t)$ into an
observed spectrum

Assuming the true limb spectrum is a power law, we may apply
this factor to obtain a model spectrum, and maximize the
Poisson likelihood of observing the data given the model.

To illustrate that this model can generate a spectrum
similar to the limb bump spectrum, we show 10 random
realizations of a $dN/dE \sim E^{-2.6}$ spectrum with this
distortion in Fig. \ref{fig:bumpmodelmany}.  Note that some of these
look very similar to the bump in real data as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Ehist-all}. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:limbfits}, we fit the energy mapping model
to the Earth limb data for various range of inclination
angle. We find a 4.7$\sigma$ excess of $30\degree-45\degree$
limb photons at 129 GeV. But note that this is only 5\% subsample of the Earth limb photon events in the public available Fermi data.


\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

Gamma-ray line emission has been considered a "smoking gun"
signature for dark matter annihilation.  We recently claimed
an evidence of gamma-ray line feature at $\sim$130 GeV
towards the inner Galaxy using data from \Fermi-LAT. While
\Fermi\ accumulating additional data, a thorough
investigation of any LAT systematics which can possibly
induce a fake line signal is timely requested.

In particular, the Earth limb photons provide a smooth
reference spectrum for null tests of instrumental
systematics. While detailed information of each event
reconstruction is not publicly available preventing us to
check the particle nature of each event, we can still check
various statistics of spatial and spectral distribution of
the line photons and the Earth limb photons, and compare the
behaviour between the two to search for indications of
spurious signal from unknown systematics.


We select earth limb photons from publically available
Fermi-LAT events and look for any suspicious line feature
around 130 GeV.  We find a marginally significant 130 GeV
feature (3.2$\sigma$) in a small subset (5\%) of the earth
limb data with a particular incidence angle range between
$30\degree$ to $45\degree$, but not in other limb events.  This
might raise concerns about the 130 GeV Galactic center
feature, even though we can think of no plausible model of
instrumental behavior that connects the two.  We note that
the majority of events with incidence angle $30\degree$ to
$45\degree$ are {\emph not} from Earth limb, but from
astrophysical sources. We have not found significant 130 GeV
feature with much larger sample of events at this incidence
angle.

%At $\sim$100 GeV, Galactic center is not particular bright. 

We argue that the limb excess could well be a statistical
fluctuation and does not look worrisome at the moment, but
the fact that an energy remapping model we invented to mimic
the effect of miscalibrate photon energy around 130 GeV
gives an even larger significance (4.7$\sigma$) makes
further studies important. A modest amount of additional
limb data would tell us if the limb feature is a statistical
fluke.  If the limb feature persists, it raises serious
concerns about the Pass 7 processing of $E > 100$ GeV
events.

During the normal survey mode, the LAT usually points away
from the Earth to avoid the contamination from Earth limb
photons. However the Earth were within the LAT field of view
with various angles with respect to the LAT z-axis during
its commissioning phase: the so called Launch \& Early
Operations (LEO) data was taken during the first 60 days of
the mission. Combined with a dedicated Earth-limb
observation in September 2008 (with two orbits i.e. close to
3 hours of direct limb observations) provides $\sim$250 hrs
total livetime of the Earth limb
photons~\cite{FermiLimb}. This data set has allowed the
study of the spatial and spectral distribution of the limb
photons and provide a calibration of the LAT instrument,
especially to check if there is any instrumental systematics
at 130 GeV producing a line-like feature.

With Pass 6 \texttt{diffuse} class events along with
post-launch instrument response functions (P6\_V3),
\cite{FermiLimb} has analyzed the spatial morphology and the
energy spectrum from the combined Earth limb photon events
which contains 218 photons above 100 GeV and 16 photons
above 500 GeV. The energy spectrum of the Earth limb photons
shows a power-law behavior with the spectral index $2.79\pm
0.06$ for 3-500 GeV photons (Fig. 2 of \cite{FermiLimb}),
which is consistent with the primary cosmic-ray spectral
index $2.75\pm 0.03$\footnote{The Earth limb photon above 10
  GeV from cosmic ray interactions in the upper atmospheric
  layers do not suffer large energy loses and the cosmic-ray
  primaries at this energy is unaffected by the Earth
  magnetic fields. The Earth limb photon should have a
  spectral index close to that of the primary cosmic
  rays~\cite{FermiLimb}. }. Note that the systematic errors
have been taken into account in the spectral fitting by
extrapolating the estimation based on Vela observations less
than 10 GeV to above 10 GeV. And the systematic error
dominates over the statistical error in the spectrum
fitting. \emph{No significant line/bump feature is revealed
  in this spectrum of earth limb photons around 130 GeV.}


We note that the additional limb data provided by LEO would
provide an exposure comparable to the limb photons used in
this paper. Detailed analysis/public release of the LEO data
from early commissioning phase would be very helpful to
study systematics of LAT around 130 GeV, if they are thought
to be of sufficient quality.  Otherwise, new limb
observations could be undertaken, in order to test the
reality of the 130 GeV limb feature.

The spectrum of the Earth limb photons provided by
\citep{FermiLimb} does not show any significant feature at
130 GeV. If improved processing of the limb photons does not
replicate the line or the "remapping error" we found for a
subsample of the limb photon during the normal survey mode,
it can be dismissed as a statistical fluke.  If it
reappears, a deeper investigation into its cause is
warranted.

Even then, it is a challenge to understand how such an
instrumental feature could be mapped so precisely onto a
localized region within 5-10 degrees of the GC.  The GC is
not near the path of the orbital pole, nor its axis of
precession.  The orbital phase, precession, Earth's orbit,
and time of year are all well mixed by the few $\times10^4$
orbits and 25 precession cycles over 1500 days.  We have
shown that the events in question are drawn from every part
of event and spacecraft parameter space available in the
public files.  In the absence of any model of instrumental
behavior that explains how these events land near the GC and
not elsewhere in the Galactic plane, it is far fetched to
say that they invalidate a result with a local significance
of $p\approx10^{-9}$.

\section{Appendix}

In Appendix, we check a couple of possible function
dependence of the Earth limb photon and compare with the
Galactic center events. 
% In Fig.~\ref{fig:rock}, we show the rocking angle
% distribution (i.e. the angle of the spacecraft Z-axis from
% zenith) of the GC line events.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:geo-lonlat}, we show the distribution of
suspicious Earth limb line events in the map of Earth
longitude and latitude and satellite zenith RA and Dec. We
don't find any strange distribution in these
coordinates. The red points are the Galactic center line
photons and the blue points are the Earth limb ``line''
events.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:spacecraft-zx}, we show the distribution of
RA and Dec of spacecraft Z axis (boresight direction) and X
axis (Solar panel direction) for the suspicious Earth limb
events. We don't find any strange distribution in these
coordinates. The red points are the Galactic center line
photons and the blue points are the Earth limb ``line''
events.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:earth-az}, we show the Zenith angle
vs. Earth azimuth angle for the Earth limb photons. The
$\theta > 60\degree$ limb photons observed in the normal
survey mode are seen predominantly to the north and south
azimuth directions, i.e approximately perpendicular to the
orbit direction. The red points are the Galactic center line
photons and the blue points are the Earth limb ``line''
events.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:sun}, we show the dependence of the orbital
precession phase and arriving time of year.
