\begin{abstract} Our recent claims of a Galactic center
  feature in \Fermi-LAT data at approximately 130 GeV have
  prompted an avalanche of papers proposing explanations
  ranging from dark matter annihilation to exotic pulsar
  winds.  Because of the importance of such interpretations
  for physics and astrophysics, a discovery will require not only additional
  data, but a thorough investigation of possible LAT
  systematics.  While we do not have access to the details
  of each event reconstruction, we do have information about
  each event from the public event lists and spacecraft
  parameter files.  These data allow us to search for
  suspicious trends that could indicate a spurious signal.
  We consider several hypotheses that might make an instrumental
  artifact more apparent at the Galactic center, and find them 
  implausible.  We also search for an instrumental signature in 
  the Earth limb photons, which provie a smooth
  reference spectrum for null tests.  We find no significant 
  130 GeV feature in the Earth limb sample.  However, we do 
  find a marginally significant 130 GeV feature in Earth 
  limb photons with a limited range of detector incidence angles.  
  This raises concerns about
  the 130 GeV Galactic center feature, even though we can
  think of no plausible model of instrumental behavior that
  connects the two.  A modest amount of additional limb data
  would tell us if the limb feature is a statistical fluke.
  If the limb feature persists, it would raise doubts
  about the \texttt{Pass 7} processing of $E > 100$ GeV events.  At present
  we find no instrumental systematics that could plausibly explain the excess
  Galactic center emission at 130 GeV.

\section{Introduction}


The search for non-gravitational signatures from WIMP
(weakly interacting massive particle) dark matter has 
generally been approached from three different directions: missing
energy searches at colliders, direct searches for the
recoil of nuclei from underground detectors, and indirect
methods including searching for dark matter signals from cosmic
rays (CR) and multiwavelength astronomical
observations~\citep{Jungman:1995df, Bergstrom:2000, Bertone:2005, Hooper:2007Review,
2012arXiv1205.4882B, Cirelli:2012tf, Bringmann:2012ez}.

For indirect detection, distinguishing the dark matter
signal from conventional astrophysical backgrounds is
challenging.  Among various possible signatures, gamma-ray
line emission is a long-sought ``smoking
gun'' for dark matter annihilation~\cite{Bergstrom:1988fp}, as no plausible
astrophysical background can produce such a line
signature.\footnote{A narrow feature is
possible in theory~\citep[see][]{2012arXiv1207.0458A}.}  Gamma-ray line(s)
could be produced by dark matter decays or annihilations
into two photons, or two-body final states involving one
photon plus a Higgs boson, Z boson, or other neutral non-SM
particle.  In most models, the branching ratio
to lines is loop suppressed relative to the continuum
emission, and one would have expected to see the continuum
first in e.g. MSSM models~\citep[e.g.][]{Bergstrom:1997}.
Although this theoretical prejudice led most previous
studies to focus on continuum searches, there are models
being proposed that allow high line to continuum
ratios~\citep[e.g.][]{Bergstrom:1998, Bergstrom:2000,
Bertone:2009, Jackson:2010, Cline:2012, Weiner:2012}.
However, previous searches in EGRET~\cite{Pullen:2006sy} and Fermi LAT
data~\cite{Abdo:2010nc, Vertongen:2011mu, Ackermann:2012qk}
did not find any
indications for a gamma-ray line signal and presented only upper limits on the
line flux.

The first claim of a line around 130 GeV by
Weniger~\citep{Weniger:2012} grew out of an earlier search
for virtual internal Bremsstrahlung signals from
annihilations~\citep{Bringmann:2012}.  Weniger focused on
spectral fitting to photon events in regions of interest in
the inner Galaxy designed to maximize S/N.  A line structure
with 4.6$\sigma$ (3.2$\sigma$ after the trials factor
correction) was found at 130 GeV. 
This claim was quickly followed up by a number of groups~\cite{tempel:2012ey,
Boyarsky:2012ca}.

Subsequent work by Su \& Finkbeiner approached the problem
with template fitting, which takes into account the spatial
distribution of events along with spectral information,
assuming various profiles (Einasto, NFW, Gaussian) for the
DM distribution~\citep{linepaper}.  If the template is
correct, this allows extraction of the DM signal with
higher S/N.  This work found 6.6$\sigma$ (5.1$\sigma$ after
the trials factor correction) for an Einasto profile
centered $1.5\degree$ west of the Galactic center, and also
suggested that there may be two lines, at about 111 and 129
GeV.  The lower energy line is tantalizing because it
matches the expected energy of a $Z\gamma$ line if the
higher energy is the $\gamma\gamma$ line.  These findings
have inspired theorists to consider a number of models~\citep{Dudas:2012, Choi:2012,
Kyae:2012, Lee:2012, Rajaraman:2012, Acharya:2012,
Garny:2012, Buckley:2012, Chu:2012, Kang:2012,
Buchmuller:2012, Heo:2012, Park:2012, Tulin:2012,
Cline:2012, Weiner:2012}.

Recent evidence for lines at 111 GeV and 129 GeV with a
local significance of $3.3\sigma$ from \Fermi\ unassociated
point sources suggests an annihilation signal is present, as
does the claim of line emission from galaxy clusters at 130
GeV~\cite{Hektor:2012kc}.  Neither of these would stand on
their own, but they provide support for the hypothesis that
the Galactic center line signal is produced by dark matter
annihilation~\cite{doubleline}.

The high statistical significance of the line
feature motivates a search for systematic errors in the
LAT data that could mimic a line in the Galactic center.
Confirmation by Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes like HESS-II might be
possible as early as next
year~\cite{Bergstrom:2012}, but in the meantime a thorough
study of LAT systematics is urgently needed.  We do not have
access to the details of the reconstruction of each photon
event, which would allow us to study how it developed in the
tracker and calorimeter.  However, we do have information
about each event from the public event lists and spacecraft
parameter files.  We can use this information to search for
any line-producing artifacts in the detector frame, and
investigate if they could map onto the Galactic center.

The Earth's atmosphere provides a convenient source of
photons for systematics tests.  The continual cosmic-ray
cascades in the Earth's atmosphere produce gamma rays with
$dN/dE \sim E^{-2.8}$~\citep{FermiLimb}.  Because these
so-called `Earth limb photons' result from atmospheric
cascades, they are produced by interactions in a highly
boosted frame, and cannot contain line emission.
\medskip

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In \Refsec{130GeV} we briefly
define key parameters of LAT photon events and describe the survey strategy.
We examine peculiarities of the Galactic center observation, possible
systematics of the LAT in the instrumental frame, and study whether they could
fake a 130 GeV line signature. In \Refsec{EarthLimb}, we concentrate on a
suspicous subset of Earth limb photons that shows a line-like excess at 130
GeV. We search for correlations with the GC line events, and introduce an
energy remapping model as possible explanation for spurious signals.  Finally in
\Refsec{Conclusion}, we discuss our findings and what is required to clarify
the status of the 130 GeV excess.

\section{The 130 GeV excess}
\label{sec:130GeV}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION II %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section, we briefly summarize the standard survey strategy of \Fermi\ 
and define the basic parameters of each event.  We
address the question of whether observations of the Galactic center
are peculiar in a way that could enhance instrumental
effects towards this direction and search for suspicious trends in
other regions of the sky and the reconstruction parameters.

\subsection{Standard survey strategy and definitions}
\label{sec:conventions}
%% A. Standard survey strategy

%%   Define parameters (See table)

%%   Discuss standard events selection.

%% B. Peculiarities of the Galactic center observation

%%   we consider 3 ways to get a spurious signal

%%   1.  Incidence angles of Galactic Center observations
%%       The orbit / scan strategy impose certain patterns on (theta,phi)
%%       just from geometry.  If there are instrumental artifacts for such
%%       events, they could map disproportionately on to the GC.

%%       We choose events at those phi values away from the GC and find no
%%       excess of events near 111 or 130 GeV.  (Figs 2,3)

%%   2.  The Galactic center is bright
%%       Because the center is bright, a flaw in the instrument / data
%%       reduction that maps events to 130 GeV might only be noticed in a
%%       bright region of the sky.  However, we have other regions (limb,
%%       plane) that have lots of photons, and we see now 130 GeV excess in
%%       those samples.

%%   3.  The Galactic center has a hard spectrum
%%       Perhaps events could be mis-reconstructed, mapping events down
%%       from higher energy.  However, there are not even enough events
%%       above 300 GeV to explain the signal, even if all of them got
%%       mapped to 130 GeV.

With a field of view of $\sim2.5$~sr, the LAT can survey the entire sky
in two orbits.  In \emph{standard survey mode}, the LAT points north of zenith
towards the orbital pole
by an angle \zrock\ on one orbit, and south of zenith by the same angle on the
next orbit.  In this mode, the LAT pointing is confined to the plane
perpendicular to its orbital velocity.  The slews are
performed with a repeating pattern of 17 waypoints defining
\zrock\ as a function of time.\footnote{The 
survey rocking angle profiles are available at
\url{http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/observations/types/allsky/}.
The effective dates and times for each profile are provided.
} \zrock\ was $35\degree$ at the start of the nominal
mission on August 4, 2008 until May 7th, 2009, and was changed
to $50\degree$ on Sep 3rd, 2009 for better thermal
management of the downward-facing battery
radiator.\footnote{Various profiles
with rocking angle 39$\degree$, 40$\degree$, and 45$\degree$
respectively have been tested for relatively short periods,
including a 3 orbit profile test that overweights the south.} 
This rocking-angle profile, combined with the precession
of the orbit every $\sim53.4$ days, allows the LAT to observe
the whole sky with approximately uniform coverage.

\Fermi\ spends over 95\% of the mission time in standard survey mode.
This is only occasionally interrupted for
pointed observations of targets of opportunity (ToOs).  During such times
the LAT may point at larger zenith angle than usual, even at the horizon.
%Pointed observations account for $<$20\%
%of the total observing time. {\bf I thought it was even much less} 
\Fermi's survey observations are
halted during passages through the South
Atlantic Anomaly, resulting in an exposure
differential between north and south of $\sim15$\%. In addition,
survey mode is occasionally interrupted by Autonomous
Repoints of the observatory for triggered
gamma-ray burst follow-up observations, and for calibration.
\medskip

The reconstructed arrival direction of photons in celestial coordinates, LAT
coordinates, and Earth coordinates is described by parameters in 
Table~\ref{tab:parameters}.  $\theta$ is the reconstructed incidence angle of
the photon event with respect to the LAT boresight (defined as the $+z$ axis).
The $+x$ axis is the line normal to the Sun-facing side of the spacecraft,
i.e.~the solar panels, which are parallel to the $y$ axis, face roughly the $+x$ direction.   $\phi$ is the
azimuthal angle of incidence with respect to the $+x$ axis.
%{\bf I think this was wrong before and fixed it -- make sure you agree -- DPF}
The Zenith angle $Z$ is the angle between the
reconstructed event direction and the zenith line, which passes from the
Earth center through the satellite center.  All angles are in units of
degrees.

Due to the increased rocking angle \zrock$\simeq50\degree$
since September 2009, photons from the Earth limb 
% (seen
% near zenith angles of $Z\sim113^\circ$; see discussion
% below) 
%{\bf (Move discussion here?)} 
entered the FOV of the LAT:
%
At a spacecraft altitude $a$, the geometric (unrefracted) horizon is seen at zenith angle \be
Z_{\rm hor} = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{R_\oplus}{R_\oplus+a}\right)+90\degree\;. \ee
The \Fermi\ orbit is nearly circular with 535~km $< a <$ 564~km, yielding
$Z_{\rm hor}$ in the 112.7$\degree$ to 113.3$\degree$ range, with the tangent
point some 2400 km distant.  At this distance, the $\sim 100$ km height of the
atmosphere subtends about $2\degree$, or roughly $111\degree < Z <
113\degree$. Combined with the large rocking angle, the Earth limb events are
dominantly seen near the incidence angle $\theta=Z_{\rm hor}-Z_{\rm rock}\sim 62^\circ$.

  \label{tab:regions}
\end{table*}

In Table~\ref{tab:regions} we define the event samples
used throughout this work: `Standard events' are all
events with the zenith angle cut $Z<100^\circ$ recommended
by the LAT team to exclude Earth
limb photons (see Section~\ref{sec:EarthLimb}); `Inner
Galactic plane' refers to a part of the Galactic disk close
to but without the center; `Galactic center' events come from
a radius of $3^\circ$ around
$\ell=b=0^\circ$; `Earth limb events' have
zenith angles $Z>110^\circ$, and are completely
dominated by photons generated in CR cascades in the
atmosphere. `Line' events refer to subsets with energies
between $120$ and $138$ GeV. This energy range is selected
since the dominant line at the GC is found to be around 129
GeV~\cite{linepaper}, and the FWHM of the relevant LAT energy dispersion is about
13.6\% at that energy~\cite{Weniger:2012}.

Throughout, we will use \texttt{P7CLEAN\_V6} events from
Aug 4th 2008 to Sep 5th 2012, with $10\GeV\leq E\leq 500 \GeV$ and the good-time-interval cuts
\texttt{DATA\_QUAL==1} and \texttt{LAT\_CONFIG==1}, however
without the commonly adopted cut on the rocking angle
$|$\zrock$|<52^\circ$, unless otherwise stated. This last cut would remove
low incidence angle Earth limb events, which will be of special interest
below.

  suspicious Earth limb events (blue dots; see
  Table~\ref{tab:regions} `Earth limb line'), as a function of
  the instrumental coordinates $\theta$ and $\phi$. The
  Earth limb contribution is clearly visible in the gray
  dots at $\theta > 60^\circ$.  Note that just because a GC line event was
  observed at high $\theta$ \emph{does not} mean it was observed near the
  horizon.}

In
Fig.~\ref{fig:phiThetaDist}, the gray dots show the
distribution of \emph{all} events (i.e.~without the $Z$ cut)
with energies above 100 GeV as a function of the instrumental
incidence angles $\theta$ and $\phi$.
The contribution from the Earth limb is clearly visible at
$\theta>60^\circ$. For comparison, the red and blue dots
show the `GC line' and the `Earth limb line' events that
will be discussed below.

\subsection{Peculiarities of the Galactic center observation}
The fact that the dominant 130 GeV line signal is near the
Galactic center raises a number of concerns.  The gamma-ray
flux at the GC is somewhat brighter and might have a harder
spectrum than neighboring regions. Also, the GC is near the
ecliptic ($\beta \approx -5\degree$) and is observed in
a restricted range of angles in instrument coordinates
$(\theta, \phi)$ when the Sun passes near it.  We consider
whether these facts could exacerbate any systematic errors
in the LAT data to produce a spurious signal.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: The Galactic center is bright, so
instrumental artifacts are more significant there.}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{plots/target_spectra.eps}
  \caption{Energy distribution in various event samples 
      as
  discussed in the text. None of them show the excess events
  around 130 GeV seen in the Galactic center. The red dotted
  lines indicate 111 and 129 GeV.}
  \label{fig:target_spectra}
\end{figure}

The hardware trigger rate of the LAT is typically
about $10^3$--$10^4\Hz$, with the rate of
accepted SOURCE and CLEAN class events below
$3\Hz$~\citep{collaboration:2012kca}, and the rate of $E>100\GeV$ events
orders of magnitude lower. In light of these low trigger rates
(and assuming steady sources and CR background fluxes) the
LAT instrumental response cannot
depend on the brightness of an observed region.
%
Furthermore, at $E > 100$ GeV, the Galactic center is only modestly brighter
than the surrounding regions, so that related effects should also appear away
from the GC. Otherwise, fake 130 GeV events would have to be mistakenly
mapped from either lower energy ($E \la 10$ GeV) gammas or much lower energy
photons (e.g.  X-rays from the 1E 1740.7-2942 microquasar~\cite{Gallo:2002} or
511 keV photons~\cite{Prantzos:2011}) in which the Galactic center is much
brighter.  It is difficult to see how this could happen.

Bright regions provide samples with a high gamma-ray-to-CR ratio,
which are used for calibration purposes by the LAT team~\cite{collaboration:2012kca}.
Besides that, their main virtue is that they feature a large number of events so
that the impact of an instrumental effect, like e.g.~energy
reconstruction or acceptance anomalies that affect the reconstruction of
gamma-ray events, can be statistically more
significant there. 
We check as a warm-up whether we find indications for
suspicious features at 130 GeV.
Besides the Galactic center (with an intensity of $\sim 8\times10^{-8}
\ph\cm^{-2}\s^{-1}\sr^{-1}$ above 100 GeV), we consider the
Earth limb (with \emph{all} incidence angles and an intensity of $\sim3\times10^{-7}
\ph \cm^{-2}\s^{-1}\sr^{-1}$ above 100~GeV~\cite{FermiLimb}) and the inner
Galactic plane
($\sim9\times10^{-8}\ph\cm^{-2}\s^{-1}\sr^{-1}$), see
Table~\ref{tab:regions}. 
%All these samples provide a large number of events;
The sample with the highest number of celestrial photons 
(but a smaller intensity, $\sim5\times10^{-9}\ph\cm^{-2}\s^{-1}\sr^{-1}$, and hence
a higher CR contamination) is
simply the whole sample of
standard events excluding the region around the GC
($\psi>10^\circ$).
For these samples, we show the corresponding energy
distributions in Fig.~\ref{fig:target_spectra}. None of the
samples exhibit an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ excess at 130 GeV as
observed in the Galactic center. Note that in the vicinity
of the bright point sources Vela and Geminga (within
$0.8^\circ$ radius, corresponding to the $95\%$ containment angle) 
only four $E>100\GeV$ events were measured, at
102.5, 111.5, 123.8 and 205.5 GeV.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra1} we show fits to the energy
spectra of the GC, inner Galactic plane, and Earth limb.  The model fits a
line on a power-law background, convolved with the instrumental response, as
in~\cite{Weniger:2012}. The $TS$ value
is defined as $TS=-2\ln \mathcal{L}_{\rm
null}/\mathcal{L}_{\rm alt}$, where $\mathcal{L}_{\rm
null(alt)}$ is the likelihood of a fit without(with) a line.  The line
normalization is constrained to be non-negative. While the TS value of 18.8 in
the GC is relatively large, there is no indication for line contributions in
the Inner Galactic plane or Earth limb samples.
%(Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra1}).

We emphasize that signal significances calculated from the GC region as
defined in this paper \emph{do not represent the full significance of the
  putative signal}, which is higher in regions with optimized signal-to-noise
ratio~\cite{Weniger:2012} or when extracted by a template
analysis~\cite{linepaper}. We use the GC region as defined here since it
should be dominated by line events, making it a good starting point to look
for suspicious trends in the data.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: The Galactic
center has a hard spectrum, making energy mapping errors more
significant.}

The Galactic center black hole (Sgr A$^*$) is visible up to 20 
TeV, and other
sources in the GC may be unusually hard. If these high energy
photons are occasionally mis-reconstructed with energies
close to 130 GeV, this could produce a line feature in the
data that would appear preferentially at the Galactic center.
In Table~\ref{tab:regions}, we list the ratio of $E>300\GeV$
events to $E>100\GeV$ events and of $E>100\GeV$ to $E>30\GeV$
events for our samples.  The
GC spectrum is not much harder than the rest of the Inner Galactic
plane, but the latter shows no sign of a feature at 130 GeV
(Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra1}). Note that
about $\sim20$ events contribute to the central part of the
line feature seen at the GC~\citep{linepaper}. 
Assuming that the GC spectrum is not
harder than $dN/dE \propto E^{-2.0}$ (normalized to the
number of events above 150 GeV), the GC events cannot come
from energies above 300 GeV, since there would not be enough
events to make up the 130 GeV excess even if \emph{all} of
them were incorrectly mapped to 130 GeV. The possibility of energy
mapping errors of events close to 130 GeV will be discussed
in Sec.~\ref{sec:EarthLimb}.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: the GC observations have a
restricted range of incidence angles on the instrument.}

If the Galactic center were predominantly observed at
specific angles in LAT instrumental coordinates, associated
instrumental problems could be projected onto the Galactic
center simply for geometric reasons. 
%The sky coverage of
%Fermi at various incidence angles is usually approximately
%uniform, but this is not necessarily the case for the
%Galactic center.  
In late December (June), the Sun crosses the Galactic disk,
and the angular
distance between the Sun and the Galactic center
(anti-center) decreases to $\sim5^\circ$. Since \Fermi\ keeps
the solar panels aligned to the Sun (the Sun is in the $x-z$ plane), this
leads to an
increase of Galactic center events at instrument azimuth
angles of $\phi\approx 0^\circ$ ($\phi\approx 180^\circ$).
This behaviour is clearly visible in the upper left panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:time_phi}, where we show the $\phi$
distribution of $>10\GeV$ events from the Galactic center as
a function of time of year.  The $\theta$
distribution in the upper right panel reflects the
precession pattern with a $\sim53.4$ day period. Integrated
over time, the $\phi$ and $\theta$ distributions look like
in the lower panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:time_phi}, where they
are shown as a function of the Galactic longitude. Close to
the GC, the $\phi$ distribution becomes significantly
bimodal. Note that this effect occurs along the full 
ecliptic,
%solar circle, %{\bf (Do you mean the full ecliptic plane?)} 
but the intersection with the Galactic disk
close to the center is accompanied by the largest number of
events.

It is tempting to relate the location of the 130 GeV excess
in the Galactic plane to this inhomogeneous $\phi$
distribution. As a test, we select standard events from the
full sky (excluding $\psi < 10^\circ$) in the range $\phi=
-20\dots20^\circ\ \text{mod}\ 180^\circ$. The total number
of these events is $\sim10$ times larger than the number of
Galactic center events; an anomaly in the event
reconstruction near these $\phi$ angles would appear in
this data sample with high significance.  However, the
energy distribution shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:spectrum_phi}
shows no significant feature at 111 or 129 GeV.

\subsection{Peculiarities of the instrument}
Instrumental effects are likely to be correlated with specific instrumental
coordinates rather than sky coordinates. In this subsection we search for
suspicious trends at 130 GeV as a function of the event incidence angles,
quality parameters, and arrival times.  We also search for the possibility of
`hotspots' at other regions of the sky; they could indicate instrumental
effects or an exotic source population.
\medskip

An error in the LAT effective area (e.g.~various cuts at $\sim130\GeV$ are
less/more restrictive for some reason) %for $30\degree < \theta < 45\degree$ 
could
in principle explain the GC line, but would also produce a line in the other
samples listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:regions}. % or in the corresponding panels
%of~Fig.~\ref{fig:polarPlotsAll} in case of $Z<100^\circ$ events. 
Exactly this already happened in the past at energies close to
$10\GeV$~\cite{Ackermann:2012qk}.
However, no 130 GeV feature
is seen in the main test samples outside of the GC (though in a small subsample
that we will discuss below). The LAT team
estimated the point-to-point correlation of the effective area on scales
relevant for line searches to be on the level of
$2\%$~\cite{Fermi:caveatsPASS7},
which is not enough to explain the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ GC or Earth limb features.

If the GC line is due to non-rejected CRs, it is hard to understand how
mono-energetic particles could be present in the CR spectrum. 
What is more,
a bright region like the Galactic center has a large gamma-ray-to-CR
ratio, such that a CR contamination would affect it last, not first.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: A 130 GeV features is visible
at specific incidence angles on the instrument.}

% Intro

One concern is that a 130 GeV feature in the
reconstructed events is visible only for events with certain
incidence angles $(\theta, \phi$) in instrumental
coordinates. The 130 GeV excess would be then imprinted on
regions of the sky that are predominantly observed at
these problematic angles.\footnote{A study of the
$x$--$y$ positions of the events inside the tracker and calorimeter
is not possible using public data only.
It is however difficult to conceive how these 
parameters could be correlated with certain regions of the
sky.}

To study line-like features at different incidence
angles, we split up the $(\theta, \phi)$ plane in different
regions as shown in the left panels of
Fig.~\ref{fig:polarPlotsAll}. We then analyse the spectrum
of all events that hit the detector at these incidence
angle patches separately and search for lines. The fits are
performed as in Ref.~\cite{Weniger:2012}, but the energy
window is fixed to 80 to 200 GeV, we assume a flat
acceptance and for a line we take a simple Gaussian with a 
standard deviation of $6\%$ (to approximate the central part of the non-Gaussian
LAT energy dispersion).

The left panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:polarPlotsAll} show from
top to bottom the results obtained (1) using all events, (2)
using Earth limb events only, and (3) using standard events
only; the latter two are disjoint subsets of the
former one. For each $(\theta, \phi)$ range we quote three
numbers: the significance of a 129 GeV line-feature in terms
of the $TS$ value, the signal-to-background ratio of the
putative line signal, and the number of events above 80 GeV
that contribute to this region. The $TS$ values are also
indicated by color for better visibility.

% Indication for correlation with $Z$ angle or statistical
% fluke
% GC line only for 50 rocking angles
% GC line independent of this range

We also compute the $TS$ as a function of energy in each region of
$(\theta,\phi)$ to check whether there is anything unusual about 130 GeV
(Fig.~\ref{fig:polarPlotsAll}, right panels). In
particular the lower two plots which correspond to
independent data sets show clearly that the enhanced $TS$
values at different energies in different panels are not
correlated. Lastly, we note that the significance of the
largest $TS$ value, $TS\simeq11$ (at $115\GeV$), has a $p$-value of
about $\sim0.3$ when taking into account
$\sim2\times23\times2$ trials over a $\chi_{k=2}^2$ distribution
(two $Z$ ranges, $23$ incidence angle panels, $\sim2$
independent search regions~\cite{Gross:2010qma}). 

Fig.~\ref{fig:polarPlotsAll} suggests that the TS values observed in some panels in case of
Earth limb ($Z>110^\circ$) events are well within the statistical expectations
once the large number of associated trials is taken into account.
% Move up this part
However, it cannot be excluded that the 130 GeV excess in
these parts of the Earth limb indicates a real instrumental
effect. Then the energy
reconstruction at different incidence angles would have to somehow
additionally
depend on the zenith angle $Z$ of the events
(e.g.~via a
subtle correlation with the rocking angle).
%, and that the
%large $TS$ values around $\theta\sim40^\circ$ actually
%indicate an instrumental effect. 
We postpone an in-depth discussion of this possibility to
section~\ref{sec:EarthLimb}; in any case more
Earth limb data will help to verify or falsify this possibility.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: The Galactic center events are flagged as badly
reconstructed.}

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=1.00\linewidth]{plots/Tkr1FirstLayer.eps}
  \caption{\emph{Upper panel:} Distribution of CTBCORE (the
  probability that the direction estimate is good) and
  CTBBestEnergyProb (the probability that the best energy

  panel}: First tracker layer to show evidence of a particle
  hit for the best track reconstruction. Tracker layers are

  layers 0 and 1 have no conversion foils). The dark (light) gray
  bars show the average over all $>100$ GeV
  standard events ('dirty' sample defined as SOURCE-CLEAN events with
  $|b|>5^\circ$); the red bars show the distribution for the GC line.}
  \label{fig:CTBquality}
\end{figure}

Although we do not have access to all details of the event reconstruction, the
extended LAT event files contain a few figure-of-merit quantities from the first step of the
event-level analysis, which inform about the quality of
calorimeter and tracker event reconstruction.\footnote{\url{http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/%
data/analysis/documentation/Cicerone/Cicerone\_Data/LAT\_Data\_Columns.html}}
CTBCORE describes the probability that the direction estimate
is good (roughly the probability that the reconstructed
direction falls within the nominal 68\% containment angle),
CTBBestEnergyProb the probability that the reconstructed
energy falls into the core of the energy
dispersion~\cite{collaboration:2012kca}. We show
these parameters for the the GC line events in the upper
panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:CTBquality}; the background histogram
shows the distribution of the these parameters in standard
events above 100 GeV. No significant bias in the distribution
appears.

The red bars in the lower panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:CTBquality} indicate the first tracker layer that
shows evidence of a particle hit for the best track
reconstruction (Tkr1FirstLayer) in case of the GC line
events.  Tracker layers are 0--17, where 0 is closest to the
calorimeter and 6--17 (2--5) corresponds to \texttt{FRONT}-
(\texttt{BACK}-)converting events (tracker layers 0 and 1 do not have
conversion foils due to requirements of the three-in-a-row trigger
primitive). The dark gray bars show the
distribution averaged over all $>100$ GeV standard events.
The light gray bars
show for comparison the distribution of a `dirty' $>100$~GeV event sample.
It is defined as all SOURCE-CLEAN events with $|b|>5^\circ$,
and hence has a high
CR contamination. The distribution of the latter is significantly biased
towards the first and last tracker layers, whereas
the distribution of GC line events is compatible with the
expectations for standard events.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: There are `hotspots' with
line-like features in other sky regions.}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{plots/hotspot_histogram.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Histogram of TS values observed in partially overlapping
  $6^\circ\times6^\circ$ regions along the Galactic disk, centered on $b=0^\circ$ and
  $|\ell|=13.5^\circ, 16.5^\circ \dots 178.5^\circ$. We show results for
  different line energies from 90 to $170\GeV$ (dotted lines), as well as all
  TS values combined (black solid line); in the latter case, the black dotted
  line is the theoretical expectation (a $0.5\chi^2_{k=0}+0.5\chi^2_{k=1}$
  distribution), the yellow band shows the $\pm1\sigma$ errors. The tail of the
  observed distribution looks as expected.}
  \label{fig:hotspots}
\end{figure}

The 130 GeV excess is located in a narrow range of about $\sim5^\circ$ around
the Galactic center. The existence of other significant `hotspots' (localized
regions with a significant line-like emission at or around 130 GeV) in the sky
could indicate an unexpected instrumental effect, or point to a new exotic
source class~\cite{Boyarsky:2012ca}. 
In absence of knowledge about the distribution of such possible
sources, we adopt the following strategy. We select partially overlapping regions of
$6^\circ\times6^\circ$ size, centered along the Galactic disk at
$b=0^\circ$, $|\ell|=13.5^\circ, 16.5^\circ \dots 178.5^\circ$. The size of
the region is chosen to include roughly 50--100 events above 80 GeV (like in our `GC
region'); regions close to the GC are excluded to avoid contamination with the
130 GeV excess. In each region we calculate the TS value for the presence of
a line at various energies. The details of the fit are the same as above for
Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra1} (in particular the energy window is always fixed to
80--210~GeV). The distribution of TS values obtained in this way is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hotspots} by the dotted colored lines for different
line energies; a combination of
TS values for all line energies is shown by the solid black line. Its tail
distribution is in excellent agreement with the statistical expectations
(shown by the black dotted line) within the $\pm1\sigma$ error bars, showing
no indication for the presence of `hotspots'. We obtain the same 
result when reducing the size of the regions,
shifting them by a common offset, or selecting random circular regions all
over the
sky with the requirement that $\sim100$ events are included. 
% Hence, regions with $\gtrsim3\sigma$ lines \emph{are} present in the data also away from the
% GC, however in complete agreement with the statistical expectations.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis: The observed signal is variable.}
% --- we might add the TS evolution after the template fitting results

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{plots/TS_time.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Time evolution of TS values. In dark (light) red we show results
  for the GC region from Tab.~\ref{tab:regions} (respectively Reg4 from
  Ref.~\cite{Weniger:2012}), in blue we show the evolution of the Earth limb
  line. The gray line indicates for comparison the TS value obtained for the
  Inner Galactic plane, where no signal is observed.  Jumps in the Earth limb
  line significance are related to times when
  \zrock$>52^\circ$, cp.~Fig.~\ref{fig:timehist}.}
  \label{fig:timeevolution}
\end{figure}

An interpretation of the 130 GeV excess in
terms of dark matter annihilation requires steadiness of the source;
a strong variability could
indicate (time-dependent) instrumental effects. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:timeevolution} we plot how the $TS$ value of
the GC signal evolved over time (assuming $E_\gamma=129.8\GeV$~\cite{Weniger:2012}). 
The dark red line corresponds
to the GC region from Tab.~\ref{tab:regions}, the light red line shows the
results for region Reg4 from Ref.~\cite{Weniger:2012}. We
compare them to the time-evolution of the suspicious Earth limb
line (blue) and the time evolution of the TS value obtained from the
Inner Galactic plane (gray). The `GC region' curve appears to have grown most
strongly between March 2011 and February 2012, and falling
during last few months; on the other hand, the signal observed in the larger Reg4
does not show the same behaviour and appears more steady. In all cases, the open circles
indicate an event between 120 and 138 GeV.
% but it lies mostly within the
% statistical expectations for a steady source (68\% and 95\% envelopes from a
% Monte Carlo analysis are shown by the gray lines). 
The curves show no strong sign for a variability of the line features.  Note
that the number of GC region line events in the first and second half of the
observational period are respectively 12 and 14.

% However, a further substantial decrease of the significance of the GC line
% signal would start to challenge any dark matter related interpretation. In any
% case, the very weak indication for a temporal pattern is not observed in case
% of the Earth limb line.

In this section, we follow up the weak excess at $\sim$130 GeV 
in the limb photons
(Fig.~\ref{fig:polarPlotsAll})
and
characterize the nature of the apparent excess more precisely.  We show that
the critical incidence angles are not (solely) responsible for
the GC excess. 
%%  while the back-scattered secondary
%% particles at large angles relative to the CR cascade
%% direction is very rare
% We begin by examining the limb events and finding a bump at
% 130 GeV in a subsample of these events. 
%We consider two
%hypotheses for the origin of the bump: (1) the events come
%from far away in energy; (2) the more subtle possibility
%that an energy mapping error could redistribute events in energy,
%thus making a spectral feature.  
We then
consider the possibility
that an energy mapping error could redistribute events in energy,
thus making a spectral feature, and
explore the various
parameters of the GC line events and the limb bump events.
\medskip

In Fig.~\ref{fig:theta-E-frontback}, we plot incidence angle $\theta$ versus
energy for limb events ($Z > 110\degree$).  For 125 GeV $< E <$ 135 GeV, we find
an excess of events with $30\degree < \theta < 45\degree$, as already indicated
in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarPlotsAll}.  This $\theta$ range contains 6\% of
the limb events for $E>100$ GeV. The 129 GeV bump is clearly visible in the
spectrum plotted in
the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Ehist-all}, and decreases for
larger ranges of $\theta$ (other panels).  The bump appears equally in
\texttt{FRONT} and \texttt{BACK} converting events.

\subsection{Energy mapping error: a model for the limb bump}

% In this subsection, we discuss then the energy remapping
% model, which enhances the significance of the 130 GeV line
% feature in the limb photons.
 
As we discussed above in Sec.~II, it is very unlikely for the
GC line to be caused by extra events (from either photons with much higher
energies or CR background); the same is true for the line feature in the low
incidence Earth limb events.  Given these difficulties, we consider the
possibility that the Earth limb bump results from an energy mapping error, and
assume that for some unknown reason it only affects low incidence Earth limb
events (and potentially the GC).\footnote{Similar to anomalies in the
effective area, one would expect that such an error should affect all
regions of the sky, in contradiction to the observations.}

We propose a simple model, in
which the mapping from true energy to reported energy,
$E(E_t)$, is linear except for a bump near some reference
energy.  Smooth low-level perturbations over large energy
scales are not relevant here, and could be absorbed in the
effective area calibration.  In order to include a
small-scale bump in the response, we introduce a local
compact perturbation in the form of a Gaussian.  It is
convenient to work in logarithmic quantities, so we take
$x=\log E_t, y=\log E$, and \be
\label{eq:yofx}
y=x - A\sigma \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right),
\ee
where $A$ is a dimensionless amplitude of the bump ($-1<A<1$
is required for monotonicity of $y(x)$), $x_0$ is a
reference log energy, and $\sigma$ is the width of the bump (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:bumpmodel}).  The effect of the distortion is
to change the true spectrum $dN/dx = dN/dlog(E_t)$ into an
observed spectrum
\be
\label{eq:dndy}
\frac{dN}{dy} = \frac{dN}{dx} \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{-1} ,
\ee
with
\be
\label{eq:dydx}
\frac{dy}{dx} = 1 + A\sigma \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
\frac{x-x_0}{\sigma^2}.
\ee
Note that that the extreme values of $dy/dx = 1 \pm A$ occur
at $x-x_0 = \pm \sigma$ and at $y=x_0(\pm1-A)\sigma$.
Assuming the true limb spectrum is a power law, we may apply
this factor to obtain a model spectrum, and maximize the
Poisson likelihood of observing the data given the model.

% To illustrate that this model can generate a spectrum
% similar to the limb bump spectrum, we show 10 random
% realizations of a $dN/dE \sim E^{-2.6}$ spectrum with this
% distortion in Fig. \ref{fig:bumpmodelmany}.  Note that some of these
% look very similar to the bump in real data as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Ehist-all}. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:limbfits}, we fit the energy mapping model
to the Earth limb data for various ranges of inclination
angle. We find a 4.7$\sigma$ excess of $30\degree-45\degree$
limb photons at 129 GeV. But note that this is only 6\% subsample of the Earth
limb photon events in the public available \Fermi\ data, and this excess is
\emph{not} seen in the other ranges or test samples.

\subsection{The Earth limb line and correlations with the GC signal}

As shown in the top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra2},
fitting the Earth limb events at
incidence angles $30^\circ<\theta<45^\circ$ with a
monochromatic line at 129 GeV instead of an energy remapping model yields a
local significance of only
$2.9\sigma$ (adopting an energy range from 80 to 210 GeV like above in
Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra1}).
However, a further tuning of the $\theta$-range yields significances up to $4.1\sigma$
(for $25^\circ<\theta<53^\circ$; central panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra2}), 
but this comes with an additional number of trials.
In any case, the overall statistical
significance for a line in the $\theta<60^\circ$ Earth limb data is 
above $3\sigma$. 
For comparison, the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:spectra2} shows a fit to the Galactic center energy
spectrum \emph{without} incidence angles $30^\circ<\theta<45^\circ$. The GC
excess is not removed by this cut, which would have indicated a spurious
signal.  
Even when removing all events with
$25^\circ<\theta<53^\circ$ from the GC region (from region Reg4~\cite{Weniger:2012}),
we obtain $TS=5.1$ ($TS=10.1$) for the Galactic center signal, whereas the
Earth limb line completely disappears.
%The adopted range $30^\circ<\theta<45^\circ$ is motivated by providing a
%large fraction of suspicious Earth limb line events in the 125--135 GeV
%range.

% Although there is some evidence for an artifact in the Earth limb line
% photons, it is unlikely that such an artifact has been mapped onto the GC to
% produce a line. 
The Earth limb line events are distributed all over the sky, as expected
(Fig.~\ref{fig:l-b}).  The arrival time of these events is concentrated during
periods of high rocking angle, because it is geometrically impossible to see
limb
events at $\theta <45\degree$ in normal survey mode (Fig.~\ref{fig:timehist}).
As already mentioned in Section \ref{sec:130GeV}, the distribution of
$(\theta,\phi)$ vs.~each other and vs.~time and longitude are as expected
(Figs.~\ref{fig:phiThetaDist} and~\ref{fig:time_phi}).  In short, none of
these tests reveals suspicious trends or correlations, or indicates in any way that
a systematic error in detector coordinates could map events specifically onto
the Galactic center.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this paper, we search the publicly available LAT data for any trends or
correlations that might indicate an instrumental origin for the spectral
feature at $\sim$130 GeV towards the GC \citep{Weniger:2012,linepaper}. 
After addressing the following concerns, we find no evidence that the 130 GeV
feature is spurious. 
\medskip

\emph{The Galactic center is bright and has a hard spectrum.} On degree
scales, the GC surface brightness is less than a factor of 2 brighter than the
inner Galactic plane.  The inner plane provides an order of magnitude more
photons, and shows no sign of a 130 GeV bump.  Even larger samples (all limb
photons, all non-limb non-GC photons) also show no significant signal.  The GC has a hard
spectrum, and at TeV energies the
GC is brighter than the surrounding plane, but even if \emph{all} events above
300 GeV (assuming a hard spectrum $dN/dE\sim E^{-2}$) were incorrectly remapped
to 130 GeV, there would not be enough photons to explain the GC signal.

\emph{Observations of the GC have a restricted range of instrumental incidence
  angles.}  It is true that the survey strategy, orbital precession, and solar
panel alignment cause a non-trivial mapping of GC events onto $(\theta, \phi)$
as a function of time of year.  Specifically, they occur near the $x-z$ plane
($\phi=0$ or 180) when the Sun is near the GC or anti-center.  However, the GC
line events are drawn from the full range of $\theta$, $\phi$, and $t$.  The
limb line events are broadly distributed in $\theta$, $\phi$, and $\ell$, with
times corresponding to pointed observations at large zenith angle.  There is no
evidence that the distribution of line events deviates from expectations.

\emph{There are excess line events in the limb data for some incidence angles.}
For a small subset of the limb data with large rocking angle (when the limb may
be seen at small incidence angles) and a particular incidence angle range
around $30\degree$ to $45\degree$, we find a marginally significant 130 GeV feature
(above $3\sigma$).  
%This feature is not observed in limb events at other incidence angles.  
The majority of events with incidence angle $30\degree$ to
$45\degree$ are \emph{not} from the Earth limb, and we find no 130 GeV
feature in this much larger sample of events at this incidence angles.  If the
limb line events are an artifact, they must conspire to only appear when the
LAT is positioned at high rocking angle. 

\emph{The bump in the limb data might result from an energy mapping error.}
We propose a simple model for an error in the mapping from true photon energy
to reported energy.  This model reproduces the shape of the limb line feature
at 130 GeV and the dip at slightly higher energy, and has a local significance
of 4.7$\sigma$.  A modest amount of additional limb data would tell us if the
limb feature is a statistical fluke.  If the limb feature persists, it raises
serious concerns about the \texttt{Pass 7} processing of $E > 100$ GeV events.
\medskip

Additional limb data are available from the commissioning period.  The
Launch \& Early Operations (LEO) data were taken during the first 60 days of
the mission. Combined with a dedicated Earth-limb observation in September
2008, this
provides $\sim$250 hours total livetime on the Earth limb~\cite{FermiLimb}. 
This data set has allowed the study of the spatial
and spectral distribution of the limb photons and provides a calibration of the
LAT instrument, especially to check if there is any instrumental systematics
at 130 GeV producing a line-like feature.

With \texttt{Pass 6} \texttt{diffuse} class events along with
post-launch instrument response functions (P6\_V3),
\cite{FermiLimb} has analyzed the spatial morphology and the
energy spectrum from the combined Earth limb photon events
which contains 218 photons above 100 GeV and 16 photons
above 500 GeV. The energy spectrum of the Earth limb photons
is a power-law with spectral index $2.79\pm
0.06$ for 3-500 GeV photons (Fig.~2 of \cite{FermiLimb}),
which is consistent with the primary cosmic-ray spectral
index $2.75\pm 0.03$.\footnote{The Earth limb photon above 10
  GeV from CR interactions in the upper atmospheric
  layers do not suffer large energy loses and the cosmic-ray
  primaries at this energy are unaffected by the Earth's
  magnetic fields. The Earth limb photons should have a
  spectral index close to that of the primary cosmic
  rays~\cite{FermiLimb}. } Note that the systematic errors
have been taken into account in the spectral fitting by
extrapolating the estimation based on Vela observations less
than 10 GeV to above 10 GeV. And the systematic error
dominates over the statistical error in the spectrum
fitting. \emph{No significant line/bump feature is revealed
  in this spectrum of earth limb photons around 130 GeV.}

The additional limb data provided by LEO would provide an exposure comparable
to the limb photons used in this paper. Detailed analysis and public release
of the LEO data would be very helpful to study systematics of LAT around 130
GeV.  New limb observations could also be undertaken, in order to test the
reality of the 130 GeV limb feature.

The spectrum of the Earth limb photons provided by
\citep{FermiLimb} does not show any significant feature at
130 GeV. If improved processing of the limb photons does not
replicate the line or the "remapping error" we found for a
subsample of the limb photon during the normal survey mode,
it can be dismissed as a statistical fluke.  If it
reappears, a deeper investigation into its cause is
warranted.

Even then, it is a challenge to understand how such an
instrumental feature could be mapped so precisely onto a
localized region within $5-10\degree$ of the GC.  The GC is
not near the path of the orbital pole, nor its axis of
precession.  The orbital phase, precession, Earth's orbit,
and time of year are all well mixed by the few $\times10^4$
orbits and 25 precession cycles over 1500 days.  We have
shown that the events in question are drawn from every part
of event and spacecraft parameter space available in the
public files. 

In sumary, we find no significant instrumental systematics that could
plausibly explain the excess Galactic center emission observed at 130 GeV.

close to the horizon. Almost all limb events are observed at $\theta\gtrsim
62^\circ$, the $\theta<60^\circ$ \&\& $Z>110^\circ$ events come from the Earth
limb during observational periods where \zrock$>50^\circ$.
